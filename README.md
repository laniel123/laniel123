### About Me

Hi, I’m Daniel Larson — a Statistics & Data Science student at UCSB with a passion for building real-world tools that turn data into insight.

Whether it’s modeling blood alcohol levels to promote harm reduction, using Spotify data to create an interactive playlist analyzer, or developing creative automation tools, I love using data, code, and storytelling to solve problems that matter (and sometimes make people laugh).

 ### What I’ve Built
	•	Anti-DUI: A BAC prediction tool powered by regression modeling and Streamlit, aimed at helping students make safer decisions around alcohol. Finalist in UCSB’s Project Showcase.
	•	Spotify Playlist Analyzer: A full-stack web app that creatively assesses emotional tone based on Spotify playlist content — integrating Python, Flask, and the Spotify Web API.
	•	GUI Automation Toolkit: Built a custom link scraper using PyAutoGUI for platforms with limited automation access, reinforcing my skills in asynchronous scripting and UI simulation.
